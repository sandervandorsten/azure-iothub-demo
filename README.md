<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
serves as purpose for demoing cloud connectivity.

### Background
<img src="images/thermometer.svg" alt="Getting Hot it Here" width="100" height="100" align="right">I started this project whilst working from home on different coding projects on Azure in the summer during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whilst working from home certainly has it's advantages, I did miss the AC that we have at the office at times. 

<br>

<img src="images/fan.svg" alt="Attaching a fan" width="100" height="100" align="left">
Whilst the temperature in my home-office sky-rocketed in June, I bought a ventilator to keep me cool. This was great, however having it turned on at all times is a bit of an overkill as it is certainly not hot all day-everyday here in the Netherlands. My ventilator however did not support temperature-based-control, hence I wanted to build this myself.

<br>

<img src="images/rpi.svg" alt="Raspberry Pi" width="100" height="100" align="right">
I had a Raspberry Pi lying around so wanted to use this as an interface for measuring temperature and controlling the ventilator. As I was working on a number of projects in Azure, I wondered if I could use their cloud services to connect this raspberry Pi to the cloud. Hence I asked myself:

<br>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 25px ; padding 0px 50px">
    <b>Can I connect a Raspberry Pi to IoT Hub to 1) to send device-to-cloud telemetry data and 2) trigger the ventilator on my desk with a cloud-to-device message?</b>
<p>

In my mind, the application should contain a few components:
- Raspberry Pi: 
    - stream temperature data from device to the cloud. 
    - listen to signal that triggers fan activation from the cloud. 
- 'Arbitrary cloud Services':
    - data should be stored somewhere
    - Once a certain temperature threshold has been exceded, a message should be returned to the Raspberry Pi to trigger the fan.

### Infrastructure
I ended up using the following azure Infrastructure in Azure:
- **Raspberry Pi** to connect sensor and fan to. This project also includes a simulated Raspberry Pi device that you can run on your computer. 
- **Azure IoT Hub**. Allows you to securely connect IoT devices to Azure cloud, from which you can further route messages to different services.
- **Stream Analytics**. Performs streaming data analysis on your IoT input data and forwards the data to specified services. 
- **Blob Storage**. Stores the Data for later inspection.
- **Service Bus Queue**. Queue used as input/trigger for Azure Functions. 
- **Functions**. Serverless function that is triggered by the aforementioned Service Bus Queue, and sends a message via IoT Hub to the Connected Raspberry Pi device.

### Control Flow

1. A Raspberry Pi collects data from a connected temperature sensor. It streams this data to an IoT Hub. 
2. The IoTHub processess incoming and outgoing requests from/to connected IoT Devices. It has a `Messaging` Endpoint, from which Stream Analytics ingests the data for further processing.
3. Stream analytics writes all telemetry temperature data to a blob storage, and writes a subset of the temperatures to a Queue on the Service Bus. In this example, we send only the telemetry data `temperature > 29` to the Queue. 
4. When a new message is stored on the Queue, a function is triggered. 
5. The function app sends a message to the IoT hub that the fan of the connected Raspberry Pi should turn on. effectively in our example this means that the fan will turn on for a while if, and only if `temperature > 29`. 
6. The IoT Hub securely forwards the message to the Raspberry Pi to start the connected ventilator.
