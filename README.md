<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project helps you setup a relatively simple Azure Infrastructure for connecting your own Raspberry Pi to the cloud. You can use this as a starting point to develop small IoT applications. It contains:
- The possibility to simulate a Raspberry Pi from your computer to speed up development
- Simple data storage in a container for 'cold' analysis
- data flowing through Stream Analytics to perform live analysis and send this along to other Azure Services
- Infrastructure as code using ARM templates so you can deploy your own easily
  - Estimated costs: **< 10EUR / Month** (if you set IoT Hub to use a free account, limited to 1 per subscription)
- An easily extendable infrastructure, for example if:
  - You want to create a dashboard with PowerBI, you can [add PowerBI as an output to Stream Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard). 
  - You want to [register more IoT devices to IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-get-started-physical) 

### Background
<img src="images/thermometer.svg" alt="Getting Hot it Here" width="100" height="100" align="right">I started this project whilst working from home on different coding projects on Azure in the summer during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whilst working from home certainly has it's advantages, I did miss the AC that we have at the office at times. 

<br>

<img src="images/fan.svg" alt="Attaching a fan" width="100" height="100" align="left">
Whilst the temperature in my home-office sky-rocketed in June, I bought a ventilator to keep me cool. This was great, however having it turned on at all times is a bit of an overkill as it is certainly not hot all day-everyday here in the Netherlands. My ventilator however did not support temperature-based-control, hence I wanted to build this myself.

<br>

<img src="images/rpi.svg" alt="Raspberry Pi" width="100" height="100" align="right">
I had a Raspberry Pi lying around so wanted to use this as an interface for measuring temperature and controlling the ventilator. As I was working on a number of projects in Azure, I wondered if I could use their cloud services to connect this raspberry Pi to the cloud. Hence I asked myself:

<br>
<br>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 30px ; padding 0px 50px">
    <b>Can I connect a Raspberry Pi to IoT Hub to  <br> 1) send device-to-cloud telemetry data and <br> 2) trigger the ventilator on my desk with a cloud-to-device message?</b>
<p>

In my mind, the application should contain a few components:
- Raspberry Pi: 
    - stream temperature data from device to the cloud. 
    - listen to signal that triggers fan activation from the cloud. 
- 'arbitrary-cloud-services':
    - data should be stored somewhere
    - Once a certain temperature threshold has been exceded, a message should be returned to the Raspberry Pi to trigger the fan.


### Infrastructure
I ended up using the following Infrastructure:
- **Raspberry Pi** to connect sensor and fan to. This project also includes a simulated Raspberry Pi device that you can run on your computer to speed up development. 
- **Azure IoT Hub**. Allows you to securely connect IoT devices to Azure cloud, from which you can further route messages to different services.
- **Stream Analytics**. Performs streaming data analysis on your IoT input data and forwards the data to specified services. 
- **Blob Storage**. Cold storage for the data.
- **Service Bus Queue**. Queue used as input/trigger for Azure Functions. 
- **Functions**. Serverless function that is triggered by the aforementioned Service Bus Queue, and sends a message via IoT Hub to the Connected Raspberry Pi device.

### Control Flow

1. A Raspberry Pi collects data from a connected temperature sensor. It sends this so-called telemetry data to it's designated IoT Hub. 
2. The IoT Hub processess incoming and outgoing requests from/to connected IoT devices. It has a `Messaging` Endpoint, from which Stream Analytics ingests the Raspberry Pi temperature telemetry for further processing.
3. Stream Analytics writes all telemetry temperature data to a blob storage, and writes a subset of the temperatures to a Queue on the Service Bus. In this example, we send only the telemetry data `temperature > 29` to the Queue. 
4. When a new message is stored on the Queue, a Azure Function is triggered. 
5. The function app sends a message to the IoT hub that the fan of the connected Raspberry Pi should turn on. Effectively in our example this means that the fan will turn on for a while if, and only if `temperature > 29`. 
6. The IoT Hub securely forwards the message to the Raspberry Pi to start the connected ventilator.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In this step-by-step guide we'll help you set up everything to get your own fan up and running. The setup is going to cover the following parts: 
1. [Deploying your own copy infrastructure to Azure using ARM templates](#deploying-infrastructure)
2. [Starting and configuring the individual services](#starting-services), specifically:
  1. [Registering a (simulated) Raspberry Pi device on IoT Hub](#registering-a-device-on-iot-hub)
  2. [Starting our analysis job on Stream Analytics](#starting-the-analysis-job-on-stream-analytics)
3. [Deploying a function to Azure Functions](#deploying-a-function-to-azure-functions)
4. TBA
